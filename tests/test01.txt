Description: Test against a baseline secure Apache configuration (port 443).
This test uses a "good" certificate (SHA-256, 365 days, matching SAN) and
strong server settings (TLS 1.2+ only, modern ciphers).

Input:
-p 443
--script=/home/kali/.local/share/nmap/scripts/vulnTLSServer.nse
localhost

Output: The script should report minimal alerts.
- Expected: 'Self-Signed Certificate' (unavoidable) and informational alerts like HSTS/Pinning.
- NOT Expected: No alerts for protocols, ciphers, lifespan, or domain mismatch should appear. This test validates the absence of false positives.

Command: nmap -p 443 --script=/home/kali/.local/share/nmap/scripts/vulnTLSServer.nse localhost
