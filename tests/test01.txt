Description: Test against a vulnerable Apache configuration (port 443).
This test uses a self-signed certificate with vulnerabilities (weak 1024-bit RSA key, SHA-1 signature, expired) and weak server settings (TLS 1.0/1.1 enabled, weak ciphers with CBC and SHA-1).

Input:
-p 443
--script=/home/kali/.local/share/nmap/scripts/vulnTLSServer.nse
localhost

Output: The script should report multiple critical and high alerts for vulnerabilities.
- Expected: Self-Signed Certificate, weak key (1024 bits), expired certificate, certificate signature SHA-1, multiple cipher alerts (CBC mode, SHA-1), TLS 1.0/1.1 support, HSTS missing, server disclosure, non-qualified hostname, cert pinning missing.
- This test validates detection of known vulnerabilities in the configuration and certificate.

Command: nmap -p 443 --script=/home/kali/.local/share/nmap/scripts/vulnTLSServer.nse localhost
