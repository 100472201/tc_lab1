Description: Test against Apache configuration allowing TLS 1.0 (Test 03).
This test uses the "good" certificate from Test 01 and modifies the server configuration (default-ssl-test03.conf) to allow TLS 1.0 alongside modern protocols.

Input:
-p 443
--script=/home/kali/.local/share/nmap/scripts/vulnTLSServer.nse
localhost

Output: The script should detect TLS 1.0 support.
- Expected: 'TLS 1.0 supported. Vulnerable to downgrade attacks.' (HIGH)
- Other: 'Self-Signed Certificate' (CRITICAL, unavoidable), and possible HSTS/Pinning alerts.

Command: nmap -p 443 --script=/home/kali/.local/share/nmap/scripts/vulnTLSServer.nse localhost
