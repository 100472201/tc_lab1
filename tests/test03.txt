Description: Test for detection of a weak certificate key size (RSA 1024 bits).
This test uses the constant "weak server" configuration (allowing TLS 1.0, 1.1, and weak CBC ciphers)
but swaps in the 'cert_test03_rsa1024.pem' certificate. This certificate
was generated with a 1024-bit RSA key, which is below the 2048-bit minimum.

Input:
-p 443
--script=/home/kali/.local/share/nmap/scripts/vulnTLSServer.lua
localhost

Output: The script is expected to detect all server-side and certificate-side weaknesses.
- Server Alerts (Correct): 'TLS 1.0 supported', 'TLS 1.1 supported', and all 'CBC/SHA' cipher alerts.
- Certificate Alerts (Correct):
  - 'Self-Signed Certificate'.
  - 'Weak Key. The certificate's public key is weak: 1024 bits rsa.'
- The script should NOT report 'Certificate signature uses SHA-1' or 'Domain mismatch', as
  this certificate uses SHA256 and matches 'localhost'.

Command: nmap -p 443 --script=/home/kali/.local/share/nmap/scripts/vulnTLSServer.nse localhost
