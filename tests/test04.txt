Description: Test against Apache configuration with weak cipher (Test 04).
This test uses the "good" certificate from Test 01 and modifies the server configuration (default-ssl-test04.conf) to offer only a weak cipher (AES128-SHA, CBC/SHA-1).

Input:
-p 443
--script=/home/kali/.local/share/nmap/scripts/vulnTLSServer.nse
localhost

Output: The script should detect the weak cipher.
- Expected: 'Cipher includes CBC mode: TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA' (CRITICAL), 'Cipher uses SHA-1 or legacy SHA: TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA' (CRITICAL)
- Other: 'Self-Signed Certificate' (CRITICAL), and possible HSTS/Pinning alerts.

Command: nmap -p 443 --script=/home/kali/.local/share/nmap/scripts/vulnTLSServer.nse localhost
