Description: Test for detection of a long certificate lifespan.
This test uses the constant "weak server" configuration (allowing TLS 1.0, 1.1, and weak CBC ciphers)
but swaps in the 'cert_test04_long.pem' certificate. This certificate
was generated with a 5-year (1825 days) lifespan, which exceeds the
366-day maximum.

Input:
-p 443
--script=/home/kali/.local/share/nmap/scripts/vulnTLSServer.nse
localhost

Output: The script is expected to detect all server-side and certificate-side weaknesses.
- Server Alerts (Correct): 'TLS 1.0 supported', 'TLS 1.1 supported', and all 'CBC/SHA' cipher alerts.
- Certificate Alerts (Correct):
  - 'Self-Signed Certificate'.
  - 'Long Certificate Lifespan. The certificate lifespan is too long: 1825 days...'
- The script should NOT report 'Weak Key' or 'Certificate signature uses SHA-1', as
  this certificate is otherwise secure.

Command: nmap -p 443 --script=/home/kali/.local/share/nmap/scripts/vulnTLSServer.nse localhost
