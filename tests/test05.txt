Description: Test for detection of a certificate domain name mismatch.
This test uses the constant "weak server" configuration (allowing TLS 1.0, 1.1, and weak CBC ciphers)
but swaps in the 'cert_test05_mismatch.pem' certificate. This certificate
is only valid for 'bad.hostname.com' and does not match the scanned host, 'localhost'.

Input:
-p 443
--script=/home/kali/.local/share/nmap/scripts/vulnTLSServer.nse
localhost

Output: The script is expected to detect all server-side and certificate-side weaknesses.
- Server Alerts (Correct): 'TLS 1.0 supported', 'TLS 1.1 supported', and all 'CBC/SHA' cipher alerts.
- Certificate Alerts (Correct):
  - 'Self-Signed Certificate'.
  - 'Domain mismatch: localhost does not match CN bad.hostname.com or SAN (...)'
- The script should NOT report 'Weak Key', 'SHA-1', or 'Long Lifespan', as this
  certificate is otherwise secure.

Command: nmap -p 443 --script=/home/kali/.local/share/nmap/scripts/vulnTLSServer.nse localhost
