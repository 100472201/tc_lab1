Description: Test for detection of non-qualified hostnames in a certificate.
This test uses the "super-weak server" configuration (TLS 1.0+, 'ALL' ciphers)
and swaps in the 'cert_test06_nonqualified.pem' certificate. This certificate
was generated with non-qualified names ('localhost' and 'server') in its
CN and SAN fields.

Input:
-p 443
--script=/home/kali/.local/share/nmap/scripts/vulnTLSServer.nse
localhost

Output: The script is expected to detect all server-side and certificate-side weaknesses.
- Server Alerts (Correct): 'TLS 1.0 supported', 'TLS 1.1 supported', and all 'CBC/SHA' cipher alerts.
- Certificate Alerts (Correct):
  - 'Self-Signed Certificate'.
  - 'Expired Certificate. The certificate has expired.'
  - 'Non-Qualified Hostname. The certificate contains...: localhost'
  - Wildcard certificate detected: SAN: *.tc.uc3m.es, SAN: *.test.tc.uc3m.es
  - 'CN not fully qualified. CN should be a fully qualified domain name.'
- The script should NOT report 'Domain mismatch' (since 'localhost' is in the SAN).

Command: nmap -p 443 --script=/home/kali/.local/share/nmap/scripts/vulnTLSServer.nse localhost
