Description: Test for detection of a wildcard certificate.
This test uses the "super-weak server" configuration (TLS 1.0+, 'ALL' ciphers)
and swaps in the 'cert_test07_wildcard.pem' certificate. This certificate
was generated using a wildcard CN ('*.localhost').

Input:
-p 443
--script=/home/kali/.local/share/nmap/scripts/vulnTLSServer.nse
localhost

Output: The script is expected to detect all server-side and certificate-side weaknesses.
- Server Alerts (Correct): 'TLS 1.0 supported', 'TLS 1.1 supported', and all 'CBC/SHA' cipher alerts.
- Certificate Alerts (Correct):
  - 'Self-Signed Certificate'.
  - 'Wildcard certificate detected: CN: *.localhost, SAN: *.localhost' (or similar).
- This test should NOT report a 'Domain mismatch' because 'localhost' matches '*.localhost'.

Command: nmap -p 443 --script=/home/kali/.local/share/nmap/scripts/vulnTLSServer.nse localhost
