Description: Test for detection of weak certificate keys.
This test uses a certificate with a weak 1024-bit RSA key, which should trigger the "Weak Key" alert.

Input:
-p 443
--script=/home/kali/.local/share/nmap/scripts/vulnTLSServer.nse
localhost

Output: The script should detect the weak key.
- Expected: 'Weak Key. The certificate's public key is weak: 1024 bits rsa.'
- Also, other alerts for protocols and ciphers if configured.

Command: nmap -p 443 --script=/home/kali/.local/share/nmap/scripts/vulnTLSServer.nse localhost
